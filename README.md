# PHY905_Projects
This is the repository for projects of PHY905: Computational Physics.

In each project, there are bascially three repositorys:

In "Report", my report gives a comprehensive summary of the project.

In "src", source codes and the makefile are given. Type "make" in command line to compile codes.

In "benchmark", some output files are stored for reference.

2018.3.5 Update for Project2

Executbales in "src" include armdiallo diagonalization; classical & cyclic Jacobi; bisection method; Jacobi and armadillo for one-electron system; and armadillo for two-electron system. Last executable require several inputs as size n, rmax and omega. Also, two unit tests folder are included, they are tests for armadillo and classical Jacobi method.

Partial resluts are in "benchmark", I don't want to include too much to cause chaos.
