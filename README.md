# PHY905_Projects
This is the repository for projects of PHY905: Computational Physics.

In each project, there are bascially three repositorys:

In "Report", my report gives a comprehensive summary of the project.

In "src", source codes and the makefile are given. Type "make" in command line to compile codes. There will be three executables corresponding to different solvers: general.x, special.x and lu.x (you can also only compile one of them). Run programs by typing "./general.x 10 100 ..." in command line, where numbers indicate "n" you would like to input. During running, excution times and relative errors will be printed in screen. Also several output files General_soulution_n.txt will be generated.

In "benchmark", some output files are stored for reference.
