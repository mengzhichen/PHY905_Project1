# PHY905_Project1
This is the repository for project #1 of PHY905: Computational Physics.
There are three repositorys:

In "Report", my report gives a comprehensive summary of the project.

In "src", source codes and the makefile are given. Type "make" in command line to compile codes. There will be three executables corresponding to different solvers: general.x, special.x and lu.x (you can also only compile one of them). Run programs by typing "./general.x 10 100 ..." in command line, where numbers indicate "n" you would like to input. During running, excution times and relative errors will be printed in screen. Also several output files General_soulution_n.txt will be generated.

In "benchmark", some outpu files are stored for reference.
