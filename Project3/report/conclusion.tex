In this work, we investigate two methods, Euler's forward and Velocity-Verlet methods, 
to solve a set of first-order ordinary differential equations with initial conditions. 
To test the performance of these algorithms, 
we use them to calculate the evolution of the Earth-Sun, Earth-Sun-Jupiter and whole solar system. 
Our comparison shows that VV method can better describe the characteristics of motion in these systems than Euler method. 
We conclude that VV method is more stable and thus better to use. 
We also use VV method to calculate the perihelion precession of Mercury by adding a relativistic correction to the gravitational force 
and obtain a $42.9''$ per century precession which is almost the same as the analytical solution.
