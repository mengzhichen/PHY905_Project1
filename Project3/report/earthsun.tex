The Earth-Sun system is a two-body system governs by the attractive gravitational force between them
\begin{equation}
	\vec{F}_G = \frac{GM_{\mathrm{S}}M_{\mathrm{E}}\hat{r}}{r^2},
\end{equation}
where G is the gravitational constant; 
$M_{\mathrm{S}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{E}}$ are mass of the Sun and the Earth; $\vec{r}$ is the displacement between them.

Given the fact the Sun is about $10^6$ heavier than the Earth, we can safely keep the Sun as the center of mass (C.M.) in this problem. 
With a proper coordinate setup, the orbit of the Earth is co-planer in $xy$-plane. 
Using Newton's second law we get the following first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the Earth

\begin{equation}
	\label{earthsunodes}
	\left\{  
             \begin{array}{lr}  
             	\frac{dx}{dt} = v_x \\
				\frac{dx}{dt} = v_x \\
            	\frac{dv_x}{dt} = -\frac{GM_{\mathrm{S}}x}{r^3} \\
				\frac{dv_y}{dt} = -\frac{GM_{\mathrm{S}}y}{r^3}.
			\end{array}  
	\right.	
\end{equation}

By solving above equations, we can obtain the informations about the Earth's orbit we need.
