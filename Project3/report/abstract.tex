In Newtonian mechanics, we usually need to solve a set of ordinary differential equations with some specific initial conditions. 
Most initial value problems do not have an analytical solution, especially for a many-body system with gravity. 
In this report we investigate the numerical methods for the initial value problem and their application in solving the solar system. 
Euler's forward and Velocity-Verlet methods are discussed and applied in the Earth-Sun, Earth-Sun-Jupiter and whole solar system. 
The comparison between these two methods shows that Verlet method is more stable and thus better to use. 
We also calculate the perihelion precession of Mercury by adding a relativistic correction to the gravitational force, 
and obtain almost the same result as the analytical solution.
