In this report, we introduce MC method and Metropolis algorithm which can be used to calculate integrals.
To study two electrons confined in a H.O. potential, we combine MC method with variational principle.
We use two different trail wave functions in our calculations.
The first one $\Phi_{t1}$ is a product of two electrons in H.O. potential wave functions with one parameter.
The second $\Phi_{t2}$ has two parameters by adding the Jastrow factor to correct behavior when electrons get very close.
We find optimal parameters and ground state energies for these two trail wave functions.
By comparing with results given by diagonalization method, validity of MC method is proved.
Moreover, $\Phi_{t2}$ gives better results than $\Phi_{t1}$ which justifies the power of the Jastrow factor.
In last step, we test the virial theorem using $\Phi_{t1}$ by adjusting the relative strength of H.O. potential and Coulomb repulsion.
The curves give right trends as expected.
